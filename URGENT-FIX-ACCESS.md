# ðŸš¨ URGENT: Fix Public Access to barodatek.com

## Current Problem
Your site has **Vercel Deployment Protection** enabled, which requires authentication.
This blocks ALL public visitors from accessing https://barodatek.com

## DNS Status âœ…
- Domain: barodatek.com is correctly connected
- DNS resolves to: 216.198.79.1, 64.29.17.65
- Project: barodatek-api-platform

## IMMEDIATE FIX (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Disable Deployment Protection
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/jynee1baroda-6483s-projects/barodatek-api-platform/settings/deployment-protection
2. Find **"Deployment Protection"** setting
3. Change from "All Deployments" to **"Only Preview Deployments"** or **"Off"**
4. Click **"Save"**

### Step 2: Verify Access
After saving, wait 1-2 minutes, then test:
```powershell
# Test in browser or PowerShell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://barodatek.com" -UseBasicParsing
```

## Why This Happened
Vercel defaults to protecting deployments for security. Great for internal projects, but blocks your public website!

## Alternative: Use Vercel Dashboard
- Login: https://vercel.com/dashboard
- Select project: barodatek-api-platform
- Settings â†’ Deployment Protection
- Disable or set to Preview only

## Next Steps After Fix
Once public access is restored, we'll:
1. âœ… Verify site loads for everyone
2. ðŸŽ¨ Build the new Arena rebrand theme
3. ðŸš€ Deploy the updated design

## Need Help?
If you see "ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED" or authentication page, protection is still on.
Just disable it in Vercel dashboard settings!
