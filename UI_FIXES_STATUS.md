# UI Interaction Fixes - Summary

## Issue Identified
All buttons with `data-action` attributes are properly wired through event delegation in `app.js`, BUT:

1. ✅ **Event Delegation Working** - Line 44-90 in app.js
2. ✅ **Download Functions Exist** - downloadCompleteProject, downloadPostmanCollection, etc.
3. ✅ **Game Functions Exist** - startGameSelector, startDebugDetective, etc.
4. ⚠️ **Games Use Hardcoded Data** - Not fetching from `/api/games/questions`
5. ❌ **Missing refreshStats Function** - Called by button but not defined

## Required Fixes

### 1. Add Missing refreshStats Function
The button calls `refreshStats()` but function doesn't exist.

### 2. Update Games to Fetch from API
Games should fetch questions from `/api/games/questions?type=<gametype>` instead of using hardcoded data.

### 3. Verify All Download Functions Work
Ensure JSZip is properly creating downloadable files.

## Status
- Buttons ARE clickable
- Event handlers ARE attached
- Some functions ARE missing or need updates

Proceeding with fixes...
