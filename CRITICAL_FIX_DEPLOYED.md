# 🎉 CRITICAL FIX DEPLOYED - Interactive Elements Now Working!

**Deployment:** October 17, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ **FIXED AND DEPLOYED**

---

## 🔴 **PROBLEM IDENTIFIED**

Your console showed:
```
app.js:1  Failed to load resource: 404
barodatek-analytics.js:1  Failed to load resource: 404
admin-access.js:1  Failed to load resource: 404
error-tracker.js:1  Failed to load resource: 404

startGame function: undefined
loadContracts function: undefined
handleCommand function: undefined
```

**Root Cause:** `vercel.json` was NOT configured to serve `.js` files as static assets!

---

## ✅ **FIX APPLIED**

Updated `vercel.json` builds section to include:

```json
{
  "src": "*.js",
  "use": "@vercel/static"
},
{
  "src": "*.css",
  "use": "@vercel/static"
},
{
  "src": "*.json",
  "use": "@vercel/static"
}
```

This ensures Vercel serves ALL JavaScript, CSS, and JSON files from the root directory.
