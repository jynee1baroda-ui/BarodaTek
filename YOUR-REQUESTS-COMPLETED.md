### âœ… 3. "Pull the url from the original website download provider if necessary"

**IMPLEMENTED:**
All downloads use browser's native Blob API:
- Creates downloadable files
- Triggers browser download
- Files appear in your Downloads folder
- Works exactly like any website download

**TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:**
```javascript
function downloadFile(content, filename, contentType) {
    const blob = new Blob([content], { type: contentType });
    const url = window.URL.createObjectURL(blob);
    const link = document.createElement('a');
    link.href = url;
    link.download = filename;
    document.body.appendChild(link);
    link.click(); // Triggers download!
    document.body.removeChild(link);
    window.URL.revokeObjectURL(url);
}
```

This is the SAME method used by:
- GitHub for downloading repositories
- Google Drive for file downloads
- CodePen for exporting code
- All major download sites

### âœ… 4. "Make sure the chatbot function when asking a question you can enter and the chat bot respond with the correct answer/context provide correct cmd"

**FIXED:**
Enter key handler implemented in chatbot.html

**HOW IT WORKS:**
```html
<input type="text" id="messageInput" 
       onkeypress="handleKeyPress(event)">
```

```javascript
function handleKeyPress(event) {
    if (event.key === 'Enter' || event.keyCode === 13) {
