## üîç Why Might Users See Sign-In Prompts?

If visitors report seeing sign-in prompts, it could be:

### 1. **They're Trying to Access Vercel Dashboard (Wrong Link)**
- ‚ùå Wrong: `https://vercel.com/jynee1baroda-6483s-projects/barodatek`
- ‚úÖ Correct: `https://barodatek-plldzqpvb-jynee1baroda-6483s-projects.vercel.app`

**Solution**: Share the deployment URL, NOT the Vercel project dashboard URL

### 2. **Google Fonts GDPR Consent (Europe Only)**
- Some European browsers may show a consent prompt for Google Fonts
- This is NOT a sign-in - just a privacy notice
- Users can click "Accept" or "Continue" to proceed

### 3. **Browser Extension Interference**
- Password managers or security extensions may inject prompts
- Not related to your website
- Try incognito/private mode to test

### 4. **Vercel Preview Deployments (Development Only)**
- Preview deployments may require authentication
- Production deployment is always public
- Make sure you're sharing the production URL

## üîí Security Configuration

Your `vercel.json` is configured for **public access**:

```json
{
  "public": true,
  "headers": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "headers": [
        {
          "key": "X-Robots-Tag",
          "value": "all"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

This explicitly marks your deployment as public and indexable by search engines.

- ‚úÖ `.vercel.app` ‚Üí They're on the public site (correct)

### Step 2: Check What Prompt They See
- "Sign in to Vercel" ‚Üí Wrong URL (dashboard)
- "Sign in with Google" ‚Üí May be a browser extension
- "Accept cookies" ‚Üí GDPR consent (not sign-in)
- "Grant permission" ‚Üí OAuth from another service

### Step 3: Test in Incognito
Have them test in incognito/private mode to rule out:
- Cached credentials
- Browser extensions
- Saved settings

### Step 4: Check Browser Console
Press F12, go to Console tab, look for errors like:
- `401 Unauthorized` ‚Üí Authentication issue
