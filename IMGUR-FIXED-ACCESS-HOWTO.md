## ⚠️ Issue #2: Site Access Restriction (NEEDS YOUR ACTION)

### The Problem:
People who aren't on your team see:
```
┌──────────────────────────┐
│  Access Required         │
│  Pending Approval        │
└──────────────────────────┘
```

### Why This Happens:
Vercel has **Deployment Protection** enabled. This requires sign-in for visitors.

### 🔧 HOW TO FIX (You must do this):

#### Step 1: Go to Vercel Dashboard
**Click this link**: https://vercel.com/jynee1baroda-6483s-projects/barodatek/settings/deployment-protection

#### Step 2: Find Protection Settings
You'll see one of these options:

##### Option A: Standard Protection
```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ Standard Protection         │
│ [X] Enable Protection       │  ← UNCHECK THIS
│                             │
│ [Save]                      │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

##### Option B: Password Protection
```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ Password Protection         │
│ [X] Enable Password         │  ← UNCHECK THIS
│                             │
│ [Save]                      │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

##### Option C: Vercel Authentication
```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ Vercel Authentication       │
│ [X] Require Authentication  │  ← UNCHECK THIS
│                             │
│ [Save]                      │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

#### Step 3: Save Changes
Click the **"Save"** button at the bottom of the page.

#### Step 4: Test
Open incognito window and visit your site - should load immediately!

## 🎯 What Each Setting Does:

### Current State (BAD ❌):
- **Protection Enabled** = Only team members can access
- **Non-team visitors** = See "Access Required" screen
- **Pending Approval** = Waiting for you to approve each visitor

### After Fix (GOOD ✅):
- **Protection Disabled** = Anyone can access
- **All visitors** = See your site immediately
- **No approval needed** = Fully public

---

## 🔍 Quick Check: Are You on the Right Page?

When you visit the Vercel dashboard settings, you should see:

### Correct Page ✅:
- URL contains: `/settings/deployment-protection`
- Page title: "Deployment Protection" or "Protection"
- Shows checkboxes or toggles for protection settings

### Wrong Page ❌:
- Just says "Settings" (general settings)
- No protection options visible
- Look for "Deployment Protection" in the left sidebar and click it

## ⚡ Common Issues & Solutions:

### Issue: "I don't see Deployment Protection"
**Solution**:
