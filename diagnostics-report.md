# Diagnostics Report — October 17, 2025

## Frontend Loading Failures
- `public/index.html` references `/assets/index-DzlB-qLk.js` and `/assets/index-CWD6Jjxl.css`, but the `/public/assets/` directory is missing. Result: the landing page ships a blank screen because its root bundle 404s.
- Legacy static assets (`public/app.js`, `public/barodatek-analytics.js`, etc.) remain present but are no longer referenced by the Vite-generated HTML, leaving legacy features (Games, Dev Tools, Analytics dashboard) unreachable.
- Multiple HTML variants (`index.html`, `index-backup-*`, `public_OLD/`, `arena_rebrand/dist/index.html`) coexist with conflicting expectations, creating inconsistent builds.

## Console / Network Errors Observed
- `/assets/*` 404 (root cause above).
- Client telemetry repeatedly posts to `/api/stats`, `/api/stats/pageview`, `/api/errors/log` but the backend previously lacked these routes, producing repeated 404 noise and queue build-up in `error-tracker.js`.
- WebSocket connection attempts to the production origin fail on Vercel (no WebSocket server), causing reconnect churn in analytics script.

## Games & Interactive Modules
- API Galaxy, Debug Detective, Syntax Speed Run, Algorithm Puzzle question sets contain only 3–5 items each; requirement is 10–15 randomised questions.
- No localStorage persistence for game progress, scores, or preferences.
- Hint buttons exist for some games but not all flows; restart / return buttons are inconsistent across modals.
- Animations and layout rely on DOM elements that are absent in the Vite shell, so these modules never initialise when the bundle fails to load.

## AI Assistant & Dev Tools
- Chatbot UI in `public/app.js` still depends on hard-coded reply templates; `/api/chat` integration is not wired in, so the assistant does not call backend logic.
- Tabs/modals for Explain Code, Learn Basics, API Guide exist in markup but have no JS bindings that fetch data or open populated content in the current bundle.
- Web search helpers produce placeholder/unsafe URLs without HTTPS verification.

## Auth & Security
- No working login/signup flows are wired to the UI. There are no OAuth provider integrations (Google, Apple, Microsoft, AWS, Vercel, Docker) or email/password endpoints exposed to the front-end.
- `server.js` contains JWT helper utilities and rate-limiting scaffolding but lacks completed provider routes or refresh-token issuance.
- IP blacklisting / lockout logic is not invoked anywhere; rate-limiting is partial and not tuned per tier.
- CSP/Helmet is configured, but inputs are not sanitised before use in several routes (e.g., matchmaking, admin endpoints).

## Backend API Gaps
- `/api/status` route is missing; `/api/monitor/*` exists but is not surfaced via a consolidated status endpoint.
- `/api/demo` only exists in the serverless handler (`api/index.js`); the primary Express server has no equivalent route.
- Matchmaking endpoints depend on API key authentication; without seeded keys the flow returns 401, making the UI unusable.
- API Explorer references endpoints that respond with 404 because routes are either missing or unexported in the current server build.

## Tooling & Build Issues
- `npm run build` simply echoes "Build complete"; there is no real bundling or verification step.
- Link checker flagged 11 broken external links (403/404):
  - https://www.npmjs.com (403)
  - https://developers.redhat.com (403)
  - https://www.blender.org/download/ (403)

- Coverage report shows only `api/index.js` under tests; core server (`server.js`) remains untested.

## Priority Fix List
1. Restore front-end bundle by copying `arena_rebrand/dist/assets` (or rebuilding) into `public/` and reconciling with legacy scripts so Games/Tools load again.
2. Update `public/barodatek-analytics.js` to gracefully skip WebSocket in production and to use the new analytics endpoints.
3. Implement `/api/stats`, `/api/stats/pageview`, `/api/errors/log`, `/api/status`, `/api/demo` within the primary Express server to mirror serverless behaviour.
4. Expand game question banks to 10–15 items each, add localStorage persistence, and standardise hint/restart/return buttons.
5. Replace chatbot template replies with real `/api/chat` calls and surface error handling in the UI (with HTTPS web-search validation).
6. Design auth flows (mock providers or real OAuth) with JWT issuance, refresh tokens, rate limiting, and secure storage.
7. Replace placeholder `npm run build` with an actual build/validation sequence (e.g., Vite build or bundler) to ensure reproducible outputs.
8. Fix broken external links or mark them as optional resources to pass link checks.

Next steps: implement fixes above, update automated tests, and rerun `npm run test:full` once routes and front-end assets are restored.
