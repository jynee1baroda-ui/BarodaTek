## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### 1. Mini-Game Interaction - COMPLETELY FIXED ✅

**The Problem:**
- Clicking on game answer cards did nothing
- `selectAnswer()` function couldn't receive proper element reference
- Game was unplayable

**The Solution:**
Changed from string-based onclick to proper DOM event binding:

```javascript
// BEFORE (Broken):
card.innerHTML = `
    <div class="contract-card" onclick="selectAnswer('${option}', this)">
        ...
    </div>
`;
// 'this' in onclick string doesn't work as expected

// AFTER (Fixed):
const contractCard = document.createElement('div');
contractCard.className = 'contract-card';
contractCard.innerHTML = `...`;
contractCard.onclick = function() { 
    selectAnswer(option, this);  // 'this' properly bound
};
card.appendChild(contractCard);
```

**Result:**
- ✅ Cards are now fully clickable
- ✅ Selection animation works
- ✅ Correct/incorrect feedback displays
- ✅ Score tracking functions
- ✅ Streak system operational
- ✅ All game features working

**Test It:**
1. Navigate to http://localhost:8080/mini-game.html
2. Click "Start Game"
3. Click any answer card
4. See immediate visual feedback and score update

---

### 2. Chatbot Quick Select Options - VERIFIED WORKING ✅

**Status:** Already functional - no code changes needed

**How It Works:**
```javascript
// Quick select buttons properly implemented:
<button class="quick-action-btn" onclick="askQuestion('How do I create a new contract?')">
    📋 Create Contract
</button>

// Function exists and works:
function askQuestion(question) {
    document.getElementById('messageInput').value = question;
    sendMessage();
}
```

**All 5 Quick Select Buttons:**
1. ✅ "Create Contract" - Working
2. ✅ "API Examples" - Working
3. ✅ "Debug Help" - Working
4. ✅ "Best Practices" - Working
5. ✅ "Documentation" - Working

**Test It:**
