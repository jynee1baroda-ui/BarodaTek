# üéÆ BarodaTek Arena - Maintenance Mode System

## Overview

The maintenance mode system allows you to display a beautiful "System Update in Progress" screen to your users while you deploy updates to https://barodatek.com. This prevents users from seeing broken content or experiencing errors during deployment.

---

## üé® What Users See During Maintenance

When maintenance mode is active, visitors to barodatek.com will see:

- **Animated BarodaTek llama logo** with glowing effects
- **"SYSTEM UPDATE" message** in retro arcade style
- **Animated progress bar** showing update progress
- **Status messages** explaining what's happening
- **Estimated completion time** countdown
- **Starfield background** with CRT scanline effects
- **Automatic refresh** when maintenance completes

The maintenance page matches your site's retro arcade aesthetic perfectly!

## üöÄ Quick Start - Recommended Workflow

### Option 1: Automatic Maintenance Mode (RECOMMENDED)

Use the fully automated deployment script that handles everything:

```powershell
.\deploy-with-maintenance.ps1
```

**What it does automatically:**
1. ‚úÖ Enables maintenance mode locally
2. ‚úÖ Deploys maintenance page to production (users see "updating" screen)
3. ‚úÖ Waits 10 seconds for CDN to update
4. ‚úÖ Restores your main site locally
5. ‚úÖ Deploys updated site to production
6. ‚úÖ Users automatically see the restored site

**That's it!** No manual steps needed.

---

### Option 2: Manual Control

If you want full control over each step:

#### Step 1: Enable Maintenance Mode
```powershell
.\enable-maintenance.ps1
```

#### Step 2: Deploy Maintenance Page
```powershell
npm run deploy
```
*Users now see "System Update in Progress"*

#### Step 3: Make Your Changes
- Edit files
- Test locally with `npm run dev`
- Prepare your updates

#### Step 4: Disable Maintenance Mode
```powershell
.\disable-maintenance.ps1
```

#### Step 5: Deploy Updated Site
```powershell
npm run deploy
```
*Users now see the updated site*

## üìã Script Reference

### `deploy-with-maintenance.ps1`
**Full automated deployment with maintenance mode**

```powershell
# Standard deployment with maintenance
.\deploy-with-maintenance.ps1

# Skip maintenance mode (direct deployment)
.\deploy-with-maintenance.ps1 -SkipMaintenance

# Auto-confirm all prompts (for CI/CD)
.\deploy-with-maintenance.ps1 -AutoConfirm
```

---

### `enable-maintenance.ps1`
**Activate maintenance mode manually**

```powershell
.\enable-maintenance.ps1
```

**What it does:**
- Backs up `index.html` ‚Üí `index.html.backup`
- Copies `maintenance.html` ‚Üí `index.html`
- Creates `maintenance.flag` (timestamp tracking)

**Safety features:**
- Won't overwrite existing backup without confirmation
- Restores on error automatically
- Shows detailed step-by-step output

---

### `disable-maintenance.ps1`
**Deactivate maintenance mode manually**

```powershell
.\disable-maintenance.ps1
```

**What it does:**
- Restores `index.html.backup` ‚Üí `index.html`
- Deletes `index.html.backup`
- Removes `maintenance.flag`

**Safety features:**
- Warns if maintenance mode isn't active
- Handles missing files gracefully
- Confirms successful restoration

---

## üîß How It Works

### File Structure During Maintenance

**Before maintenance:**
```
index.html          ‚Üê Your main site
maintenance.html    ‚Üê Maintenance template
```

**During maintenance:**
```
index.html          ‚Üê Contains maintenance.html content (what users see)
index.html.backup   ‚Üê Your original site (safely backed up)
maintenance.html    ‚Üê Maintenance template (unchanged)
maintenance.flag    ‚Üê Timestamp flag
```

**After maintenance:**
```
index.html          ‚Üê Your main site (restored)
maintenance.html    ‚Üê Maintenance template (ready for next time)
```

---

## üéØ Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Quick Hotfix
You found a bug and need to deploy a fix ASAP:

```powershell
# Automated - 1 command, ~2 minutes
.\deploy-with-maintenance.ps1
```

---

### Use Case 2: Major Update
You're deploying big changes and want to test maintenance page first:

```powershell
# Step-by-step manual control
.\enable-maintenance.ps1
npm run dev  # Test maintenance page locally
npm run deploy  # Deploy maintenance page

# Make your changes, test them

.\disable-maintenance.ps1
npm run dev  # Test restored site locally
npm run deploy  # Deploy updated site
```

---

### Use Case 3: Emergency Maintenance
You need to take the site down temporarily without deploying:

```powershell
.\enable-maintenance.ps1
npm run deploy  # Site shows "updating" message

# Fix issues, investigate problems

.\disable-maintenance.ps1
npm run deploy  # Site restored
```

---

## ‚ö° Advanced Features

### Custom Maintenance Messages

Edit `maintenance.html` to customize:

**Status messages** (line ~140):
```javascript
const statuses = [
    'Initializing deployment',
    'Updating server components',
    'Deploying new features',
    'Optimizing performance',
    'Running final checks',
    'Almost ready'
];
```

**Estimated time** (line ~151):
```javascript
const remainingMinutes = Math.ceil((100 - progress) / 20);
```

**Auto-refresh interval** (line ~178):
```javascript
const checkInterval = setInterval(async () => {
    // Check every 5 seconds
}, 5000);
```

---

### CI/CD Integration

For automated deployments (GitHub Actions, etc.):

```powershell
# Non-interactive deployment
.\deploy-with-maintenance.ps1 -AutoConfirm
```

Or skip maintenance for minor updates:

```powershell
.\deploy-with-maintenance.ps1 -SkipMaintenance -AutoConfirm
```

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Features

### Automatic Backups

---

## üé® Customization

### Change Maintenance Page Appearance

Edit `maintenance.html`:

**Colors:**

    background: #000;  /* Background color */
    color: #00ff41;    /* Main text color */
}

h1 {
    text-shadow: 0 0 10px #00ff41;  /* Glow color */
}
```

```css
.progress-bar {
    background: linear-gradient(90deg, #00ff41, #ff6b00, #00ff41);
}
```

**Logo:**
```html
<img src="barodatek-logo.png" alt="BarodaTek Llama Logo" class="logo">
```

---

## üìä Monitoring

### Check Maintenance Status Locally

```powershell
# Check if maintenance mode is active
Test-Path "index.html.backup"  # Returns True if active

# View maintenance flag
Get-Content "maintenance.flag" | ConvertFrom-Json
```

### Check Live Site Status

Visit https://barodatek.com:
- **Maintenance mode:** See "SYSTEM UPDATE" page
- **Normal mode:** See full BarodaTek Arena site

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Problem: Maintenance page stuck on production

**Cause:** Deployment failed or script interrupted

**Solution:**
```powershell
# Restore locally
.\disable-maintenance.ps1

# Deploy restored site
npm run deploy
```

---

### Problem: "index.html.backup already exists" error

**Cause:** Previous maintenance session didn't complete

**Solution:**
```powershell
# Check backup
Get-Content "index.html.backup" -TotalCount 10

# If it's your original site, restore it
.\disable-maintenance.ps1

# If you want to override
.\enable-maintenance.ps1
# Type 'y' when prompted to override
```

---

### Problem: Maintenance page not showing on production

**Cause:** CDN cache delay

**Solution:**
1. Wait 30-60 seconds for CDN to update
2. Hard refresh browser: `Ctrl + Shift + R`
3. Check direct URL (bypasses CDN)
4. Redeploy if issue persists

---

## üìù Best Practices

### ‚úÖ DO:
- Always test maintenance page locally first (`npm run dev`)
- Use `deploy-with-maintenance.ps1` for automated workflow
- Wait 10-30 seconds between deployments for CDN
- Document what changes you're deploying
- Keep backups before major updates

### ‚ùå DON'T:
- Don't delete `index.html.backup` manually during maintenance
- Don't deploy while maintenance mode is active (use scripts)
- Don't edit `index.html` directly during maintenance
- Don't skip verification steps
- Don't deploy without testing locally first

---

## üö¶ Deployment Workflow Comparison

### Without Maintenance Mode:
```
1. Deploy changes
2. Users may see errors during deployment
3. CDN cache updates (30-60 seconds of issues)
4. Site works again
```
**User experience:** ‚ö†Ô∏è May see broken content

---

### With Maintenance Mode:
```
1. Deploy maintenance page
2. Users see "System Update" screen
3. Deploy actual changes
4. Users automatically see updated site
```
**User experience:** ‚úÖ Professional update message
