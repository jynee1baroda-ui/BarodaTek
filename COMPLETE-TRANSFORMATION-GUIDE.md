## 🎨 BACKGROUND TRANSFORMATION

### Galaxy Theme Details:

**Before:**

- Static stars
- Basic appearance

**After:**
- **3-layer depth effect**:

  - Fast-moving stars (front layer)
  - Slow-moving colored stars (back layer)
- **Animated nebula clouds**: Purple, blue, and cyan glows
- **Moving stars**: Two different speeds for parallax effect
- **Performance optimized**: Pure CSS, no performance impact

**Technical:**
```css
/* Multi-layer starfield */
body::before { /* Fast layer - 300s */
body::after  { /* Slow layer - 500s */
```

---

## 📊 REAL-TIME STATS - HOW IT WORKS

### Under the Hood:

```javascript
// Stats update every 3 seconds
setInterval(updateRealTimeStats, 3000);

// Simulates realistic changes:
- Visitors: fluctuate by -1, 0, or +1
- Views: increase by 0-5
- Requests: increase by 0-10
- Requests/min: fluctuate realistically
```

### What You See:
- **Smooth animations**: Numbers count up (not instant)
- **Realistic behavior**: Stats change like real analytics
- **Live indicator**: Green dot pulses
- **Formatted numbers**: Commas for thousands (e.g., "15,247")
