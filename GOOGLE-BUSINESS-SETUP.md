# Google Business Review Setup Guide

## üéØ Quick Setup

### Step 1: Get Your Google Business Review URL

1. Go to your Google Business Profile: https://business.google.com/
2. Find your business listing
3. Look for the "Get more reviews" option
4. Copy your review URL (it should look like one of these):
   - `https://g.page/r/YOUR_PLACE_ID/review`
   - `https://search.google.com/local/writereview?placeid=YOUR_PLACE_ID`

### Step 2: Update the Server Configuration

Open `server.js` and find this line (around line 2935):

```javascript
const googleReviewUrl = 'https://g.page/r/YOUR_GOOGLE_PLACE_ID/review';
```

Replace `YOUR_GOOGLE_PLACE_ID` with your actual Google Place ID.

### Step 3: Test the Integration

1. Visit your website
2. Click "Write a Review"
3. Fill out the review form
4. Submit the review

    auth: {
        user: 'barodatek.services@gmail.com',
        pass: 'YOUR_APP_PASSWORD' // Use Gmail App Password, not regular password
    }
});

// Then in your endpoints, replace console.log with:
await transporter.sendMail({
    from: 'barodatek.services@gmail.com',
    to: 'barodatek.services@gmail.com',
    subject: notificationSubject,
    text: notificationBody
});
```

### Option 2: SendGrid (Free tier available)
