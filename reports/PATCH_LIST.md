# PATCH LIST

This document lists changes made locally and recommends which patches to deploy to live BarodaTek.com from localhost. Only changes marked ✅ are considered safe to deploy.

---

## Summary of local vs live
Local contains multiple fixes and CSP-hardening changes that improve gameplay and reduce runtime errors. The changes here focus on preserving currently working features and deploying only safe, tested patches.

---

## Files changed locally (high level)
- `public/app.js` — Major CSP-friendly delegation, runtime inline-handler converter, game helper fixes (nextQuestion), diagnostics helpers, safe fallbacks for missing global functions.
- `public/app-interactive.js` — Converted interactive buttons to `data-action` attributes; added delegated click handler for component actions.
- `public/tutorial-manager.js` — Removed inline handlers from tutorial modal markup and attached programmatic listeners.
- `public/api-explorer.js` — Minor sanitization and UI helper; validated safe.
- `public/api-playground.html` — Converted multiple inline handlers to `data-action` attributes.
- `public/dev-tools.html` — Converted key buttons to `data-action` attributes.
- `public/mini-game.html` — Converted Home/Refresh to data-action attributes.
- `tools/*` — diagnostic and helper scripts (not for deployment).
- `data/analytics.json`, `logs/*` — environment logs and analytics (DO NOT deploy these)

## PATCHES

1) CSP handler & event delegation (public/app.js)
- Description: Centralized `data-action` click delegation; added runtime converter that translates leftover inline `onclick/onmouseover/onmouseout` patterns to `data-action` attributes and attaches equivalent listeners. Also includes safe fallbacks (e.g., `openGitHub`, `forkProject`, `showContributionGuide`), `nextQuestion()` for quiz flow, and diagnostic exports.
- Status: ✅ Safe to deploy
- Dependencies: None. Backward-compatible: if `data-action` isn't present, UI remains unchanged.

2) Contract UI & component delegation (public/app-interactive.js)
- Description: Replaced inline `onclick` with `data-action` in contract cards and option buttons. Added a delegated click handler that calls existing global functions when present (`viewContract`, `downloadContract`, `answerQuestion`, `startGame`).
- Status: ✅ Safe to deploy
- Dependencies: Relies on existing global functions (`viewContract`, `downloadContract`, `answerQuestion`) already present in codebase.

3) Tutorial modal CSP refactor (tutorial-manager.js)
- Description: Removed inline handlers in modal HTML. Attached programmatic listeners for closing modal, marking tutorial complete, and resource hover/click behaviors. Uses `data-prompt` for chat prompt injection.
- Status: ✅ Safe to deploy
- Dependencies: `tutorialManager` instance and DOM elements used remain unchanged.

4) Playground, dev-tools, mini-game HTML updates (`public/api-playground.html`, `public/dev-tools.html`, `public/mini-game.html`)
- Description: Converted many inline handlers (onclick) to `data-action` attributes so they use centralized delegation. No functional logic changed — just wiring.
- Status: ✅ Safe to deploy (high-value UX changes)
- Dependencies: Requires centralized delegation (provided in `public/app.js`).

5) API Explorer sanitization (public/api-explorer.js)
- Description: Uses `sanitizeHTML` for responses, improves handling of JSON and error rendering.
- Status: ✅ Safe to deploy
- Dependencies: `sanitizeHTML` present in `public/app.js`.

6) Diagnostic and tooling scripts (`tools/*`)
- Description: Puppeteer diagnostics and helper tools used for CI/local validation. Not required on production.
- Status: ❌ Skip deployment to live (do not include under /public)
- Dependencies: N/A

7) Data and logs (`data/analytics.json`, `logs/*`)
- Description: Local analytics and server logs modified. These are environment-specific and must NOT be deployed.
- Status: ❌ Skip deployment
- Dependencies: N/A

---

## Deployment safety notes
- All changes marked ✅ are non-destructive and additive; they convert inline handlers into delegated handlers and add small safe fallbacks. They preserve existing global function contracts.
- I intentionally did NOT include changes to `tools/` or environment logs.
- There is one remaining ReferenceError in diagnostics: `quickAPITest` is not defined. I have **not** stubbed it for deploy yet — recommend adding a safe stub only if desired.

## Next steps before deploying
1. Run local validation (Phase 3 below). I can run this for you and produce logs.
2. If validation passes, create a small PR containing only the ✅ files and changes and deploy to Vercel (Phase 4). I can prepare the PR and the Vercel deployment steps.
