[X] Standard Protection  ← UNCHECK THIS BOX
```

#### Or this:
```
Password Protection
[X] Enable Password  ← UNCHECK THIS BOX
```

#### Or this:

[X] Require Authentication  ← UNCHECK THIS BOX
```

### Step 3: Save

## 🆕 **New Production URL**
**https://barodatek-4s24zidru-jynee1baroda-6483s-projects.vercel.app**

Test this URL in incognito mode - it should load without any login prompt.

---

## ✅ **What This Fixes**

### Before:
- ❌ Users see "Access Required"
- ❌ Shows "Pending Approval"
- ❌ Site not accessible

### After:
- ✅ Users go directly to your site
- ✅ No login required
- ✅ Full public access

---

## 🔍 **Why This Happened**

Vercel has **Deployment Protection** enabled by default on some plans. This adds a login gate to your site. We need to disable it in the dashboard settings.

**This is NOT a code issue** - your code is perfect. It's just a Vercel account setting.

---

## 📱 **Test It Works**

1. Open incognito/private browsing window
2. Visit: https://barodatek-4s24zidru-jynee1baroda-6483s-projects.vercel.app
3. Should load immediately ✅

---

## ⚠️ **Important Notes**

- **You MUST use the Vercel dashboard** - code changes won't fix this
- **Protection settings override everything** - even your vercel.json config
- **Takes effect immediately** - no need to redeploy after changing

## 🎯 **Bottom Line**
