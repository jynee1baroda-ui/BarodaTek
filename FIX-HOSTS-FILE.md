# üö® CRITICAL FIX: Remove Hosts File Mapping

## The Real Problem
Your Windows hosts file is redirecting `barodatek.com` to `127.0.0.1` (localhost)!

This means:
- ‚úÖ Vercel deployment is working fine
- ‚úÖ Domain is connected to Vercel
- ‚ùå **YOUR COMPUTER** redirects all barodatek.com traffic to localhost
- ‚ùå Public visitors likely CAN access your site, but YOU can't!

## Current Hosts File Contents
```
127.0.0.1 barodatek.com
127.0.0.1 www.barodatek.com
```

## ‚úÖ FIX (Takes 1 minute)

### Option 1: Manual Edit (Easier)
I just opened Notepad for you with the hosts file.

1. Find these two lines:
   ```
   127.0.0.1 barodatek.com
   127.0.0.1 www.barodatek.com
   ```

2. **DELETE both lines** or comment them out with `#`:
   ```
   # 127.0.0.1 barodatek.com
   # 127.0.0.1 www.barodatek.com
   ```

3. Save the file (Ctrl+S)
4. Close Notepad

### Option 2: PowerShell Command (Run as Administrator)
```powershell
# Run PowerShell as Administrator, then:
$hostsPath = "C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts"
$hosts = Get-Content $hostsPath
$newHosts = $hosts | Where-Object { $_ -notmatch "barodatek.com" }
$newHosts | Set-Content $hostsPath -Force
```

## Verify the Fix

After removing the hosts file entries:

### Flush DNS Cache
```powershell
ipconfig /flushdns
```

### Test Access
```powershell
# Should now connect to Vercel's servers!
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://barodatek.com" -UseBasicParsing
```

### Check DNS Resolution
```powershell
nslookup barodatek.com
# Should show: 216.198.79.1, 216.198.79.65
# NOT 127.0.0.1!
```

## Why This Happened
The hosts file mapping was likely added during earlier testing to use a local development domain. This is common for local dev, but blocks access to the production site!

## After the Fix
- ‚úÖ Your site will load from Vercel
- ‚úÖ You'll see the live production version
- ‚úÖ No more "ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED"
- ‚úÖ Public can access (they never had this problem!)

**Action Required**: Edit the hosts file now (Notepad is open), then flush DNS!
