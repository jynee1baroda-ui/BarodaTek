# Puppeteer Verification Report Template

URL tested: http://localhost:9000
Date: 2025-10-20T02:02:46.249Z
Tester: Automated run

## Summary
- Overall result: PASS / FAIL
- Passed checks: (list)
- Failed checks: (list)

## Checks performed (expected behavior)
1. Homepage loads (HTTP 200 and networkidle2) — expected: load completes.
2. API Galaxy launcher found and opens — expected: API Galaxy panel/modal appears and is visible when launched.
3. Launching any other game hides API Galaxy — expected: after launching Debug Detective / Syntax Speed / Algorithm Puzzle, the API Galaxy UI is not visible.
4. In-game controls present and functional (Quiz): hint, reveal, skip, answer — expected: each control triggers UI change or advances question text.
5. Debug Detective interactions: hint/reveal/submit — expected: results area updates.
6. Syntax Speed interactions: hint/reveal/submit — expected: results area updates.
7. Algorithm Puzzle interactions: hint/reveal/choose — expected: results area updates.
8. No uncaught ReferenceError or critical console errors during flows — expected: console logs free of 'ReferenceError' exceptions.
