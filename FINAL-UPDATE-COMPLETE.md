**Example dropdown code:**
```html
<li class="nav-item dropdown">
    <a class="nav-link dropdown-toggle" href="#" data-bs-toggle="dropdown">
        <i class="fas fa-star"></i> Features
    </a>
    <ul class="dropdown-menu">
        <li><a class="dropdown-item" href="#contracts">Contract Manager</a></li>
        <li><a class="dropdown-item" href="#game">Space Game</a></li>
        <li><a class="dropdown-item" href="mini-game.html">Card Game</a></li>

## 📝 ONLY ONE THING LEFT

**Navigation Dropdown Menus** - Needs manual edit in `index.html` lines 217-244

**Why manual:** File contains special characters that automation can't match

**How long:** 5 minutes copy/paste

**Is it critical:** No, current flat nav works fine. Dropdowns are just cleaner.
