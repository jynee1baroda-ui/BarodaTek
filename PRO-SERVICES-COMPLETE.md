## 🌐 Current Production URLs

**Main Site:**
```
https://barodatek-api-platform-88lp5qs34-jynee1baroda-6483s-projects.vercel.app
```

**Pro Service Tools:**
- API Health Monitor: `/api-health-monitor.html`
- Team Collaboration: `/team-collaboration.html`
- Auto Deploy Pro: `/auto-deploy-pro.html`
- Analytics Pro: `/analytics-pro.html`
- Security Guardian: `/security-guardian.html`
- Database Manager: `/database-manager.html`

## 📊 URL Consistency Solution

### The Problem
Vercel generates unique URLs for each deployment with random hashes:
- `barodatek-79j1mznjj-...` (old deployment)
- `barodatek-e2ktmn01e-...` (old deployment)
- `barodatek-api-platform-88lp5qs34-...` (new deployment)

### The Solution
**Option 1: Use Vercel's Production Domain** (FREE)
- After linking your project, Vercel provides a consistent production URL
- Go to: https://vercel.com/jynee1baroda-6483s-projects/barodatek-api-platform
- Look for the "Production Domain" - this is your stable URL

**Option 2: Buy Custom Domain** ($10-15/year)
- Purchase `barodatek.com` from Namecheap/GoDaddy
- Add to Vercel project settings
- URL becomes: `https://barodatek.com` (never changes!)

**Option 3: Upgrade to Vercel Pro** ($20/month)
- Get custom `.vercel.app` aliases
- Set aliases like: `barodatek.vercel.app`, `barodatek-api.vercel.app`

### Recommended: Buy a Domain!
**Best value**: $12/year for consistent branding
1. Go to [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com)
2. Search for `barodatek.com`
3. Purchase domain
4. In Vercel dashboard → Settings → Domains
5. Add `barodatek.com` and `www.barodatek.com`
6. Update DNS as instructed
7. **Done!** Your URL is now permanent: `https://barodatek.com`
